# Ride Data Analysis by City Type (PyBer_Analysis)

## Overview:

In this analysis we have used a ride-sharing database to create a summary dataframe that illustrates ride data by three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. From this dataframe we are able to create the following graph of the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results:

From the graph above you can see that when we tabulate the total fares by city type urban city types are the most profitable followed by the suburban and rural markets in that order. Not shown in this graph is other information we pulled from the data such as total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver. These give us clearer insights to other phenomena at play, such as the fact that even though rural rides account for the lowest profits and frequency of rides they also represent the most expensive fares. This is easily explained as driving longer distances will accrue higher fares and could act as a deterrent to using more frequently.

## Summary:


After looking over the whole of this data we can make a few comfortable assessments for future business decisions. The bulk of our business is in dense urban cores. Both our marketing and hiring efforts should be concentrated there. We can also see a modest increase in activity as the months warm up from winter to spring, so we want to make any efforts to shore up available drivers and application support in anticipation of those busier months.
